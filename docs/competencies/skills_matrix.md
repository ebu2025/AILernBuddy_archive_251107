# Comprehensive Competency Mapping & Skills Matrix

This skills matrix captures the core competencies for three major domains—business, mathematics, and languages. It integrates Bloom's Taxonomy (cognitive complexity), KSA (knowledge, skills, attitudes), HSK proficiency for Mandarin Chinese, and current AI literacy research. Each competency lists granular descriptors, assessment criteria, and clear progression levels that can be dynamically updated as the curriculum evolves.

## Governance Principles

- **Evidence-Based Alignment:** Competency descriptors map to international standards including Bloom's Taxonomy, HSK levels, ISO 21001 for educational organizations, AACSB business accreditation standards, and Common Core (mathematics).
- **Transparency:** Each progression level specifies observable behaviors and measurable assessment criteria.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Competency objects are versioned and tagged with metadata (last review, data source, owner) to support continuous improvement and AI-driven recommendations.
- **KSA Integration:** Every competency is decomposed into knowledge (K), skills (S), and attitudes (A) components to inform holistic curriculum and assessment design.
- **AI Literacy Lens:** AI-related sub-competencies reference frameworks such as AIED 2023 guidelines and EU DigComp 2.2 to ensure learners build responsible AI capabilities.

## Dynamic Update Mechanism

1. **Metadata Schema:** Each competency record includes fields for version, owner, last review date, evidence sources, and linked learning resources (xAPI statements).
2. **Evidence Repository:** Store exemplar artifacts (e.g., top-performing portfolios, AI ethics reports) in a tagged repository to inform rubrics and calibration.
3. **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Collect learner analytics (time-on-task, mastery scores) and educator feedback. Use LLM-powered analytics to surface emerging competencies (e.g., prompt engineering) for review.
4. **Governance Workflow:** Quarterly review board validates updates against standards, ensuring traceability and auditable change logs.

## Curriculum & Assessment Recommendations

- **Curriculum Design:** Map learning objectives to the competencies above. Sequence modules so learners progress through Bloom levels, ensuring prerequisite KSA components are met.
- **Assessment Strategy:** Combine formative analytics (auto-graded quizzes, AI speech analysis) with summative human-evaluated tasks. Align rubrics to AACSB, CCSS, ACTFL, and HSK descriptors.
- **Personalized Learning:** Leverage adaptive learning paths that diagnose KSA gaps and recommend targeted micro-learning assets. Integrate reflective prompts to strengthen attitudes.
- **Faculty Development:** Provide instructors with competency playbooks, exemplars, and AI co-teaching guidelines.
- **Quality Assurance:** Use dashboards to track mastery distribution, validity of assessments, and alignment with international benchmarks.

## Next Steps

1. Operationalize this matrix in the learning platform's data models (e.g., `competency_id`, `ksa_focus`, `bloom_level`).
2. Build analytics dashboards for competency progression using xAPI data streams.
3. Pilot with a cohort, gather feedback, and iterate on descriptors and criteria.
4. Expand to additional domains (e.g., data science, entrepreneurship) as new competencies emerge.
